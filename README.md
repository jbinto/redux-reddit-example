# jbinto/redux-reddit-example

## Overview

This is an example of a Redux + React application accessing the Reddit API.

I am following the Redux advanced async documentation here:

http://rackt.org/redux/docs/advanced/AsyncActions.html

Trying to do this in a TDD-fashion.

## Usage

### Running tests

```
npm run test:watch
```

### Starting `webpack-dev-server`

```
npm start
```
